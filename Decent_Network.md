## Decent Network

Decent Network builds a decentralized Friend Network (DHT-based) where identity is a public key, communication is permissioned by friendship, and presence/events are native—then layers storage, data access, and intelligence so Web3 + AI apps can ship without rebuilding invisible infrastructure.

### The missing layer after the chain
Blockchains excel at verifiable credentials and state: ownership, permissions, attestations, assets. But applications that feel “alive” still require off-chain infrastructure:
- real-time communication (text/voice/video/meetings)  
- relationship boundaries (who can reach whom, who can see whom)  
- offline content and media availability  
- data access (indexing, caching, aggregation, queries)  
- intelligence services (inference, execution, tool use)

AI-assisted coding reduces build cost, but it doesn’t remove the system problem: permission boundaries, scalable interaction/data primitives, and avoiding platform lock-in.

### The Friend Network: making protocols “alive”
Many identity/relationship/social protocols struggle to reach daily use because they lack a living interaction layer. If identity and relationships can’t naturally translate into reachability, interaction, and presence, retention and network effects don’t compound.

Decent Network’s base layer is a DHT-based Friend Network built around **connectivity and boundaries**:
- Portable identity: users generate their own keypairs; the public key is the network ID  
- Permissioned communication: two-way communication requires an explicit friend relationship  
- Symmetric rule for services: providers/agents establish a relationship before two-way communication  
- Default anti-spam: strangers can’t message by default; boundaries are network-native  
- Presence & events: online/offline/busy plus optional status updates propagate to authorized viewers as an event stream  

This shifts a core piece of “platform power” away from centralized gateways. Reachability and visibility become network primitives, not proprietary app logic.

### Services layered on top
On top of the Friend Network connectivity layer, Decent Network offers shareable capabilities:
- Storage: offline files/media availability and durability  
- Data access: indexing/cache/query/aggregation so apps can use data smoothly  
- Intelligence: model/inference/execution access and composition for AI-native products  
- Accounts & profiles: naming, profile primitives, permission scopes and sharing  

This lets teams focus on product and growth rather than rebuilding invisible infrastructure every time.

### Beagle Chat’s role
Beagle Chat is the flagship application on Decent Network (iOS/Android/Web):
- validates the primitives with real users in production  
- distills reusable client capability (Beagle Chat Framework)  
- provides a production-grade reference implementation for future apps

Decent Network’s goal isn’t “one social app.” It’s a scalable decentralized infrastructure network: more nodes provide capacity, more apps reuse capability, and users carry identity and relationships across apps—creating migratable, compounding network effects.
