Developing interactive apps is hardest not in the interface, but in the invisible systems: real-time communication, push notifications, offline storage, accounts and identities, permission relationships, data access, and long-term scalability.  
Decent Network: A decentralized messaging, data, and intelligent services network that provides essential app capabilities such as instant messaging, storage, accounts, and data access, while supporting efficient access and invocation of public chains like Solana/Ethereum/Bitcoin and model inference capabilities.  
The Beagle Chat Framework originates from the production implementation of the Beagle Chat client already available on app stores; it abstracts reusable client structures and standard capabilities (Swift/Kotlin + React Native), with built-in wallet + decentralized identity + Name/Profile.
