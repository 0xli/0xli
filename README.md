# 👋 Hi, I'm Wei Li (0xli)
...

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a software engineer and founder currently focused on building the future of social network.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🛠 Building **[Decent Network](https://decent.network)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/decentnetworks)) — a true social network infrastructure where **identities and data are owned by users**, not corporations.
- 💬 Creator of **[Beagle Chat](https://beagle.chat)** — a decentralized messaging and payment app powered by **Web3** and **AI voice agents**, running on the Decent Network.
- 🌐 Advocate for open ecosystems: unlike Facebook or WeChat, where only the app provider controls the data, **Decent Network** lets anyone build apps that access social data **equally and fairly**.
- 🌱 Passionate about the convergence of **Web3, AI, and social systems**, empowering both humans and autonomous agents (bots) to coexist and interact securely.

## 💬 What is Beagle Chat?

**[Beagle Chat](https://beagle.chat)** is the first flagship application built on **[Decent Network](https://decent.network)**. It’s more than just a messenger — it's your portal to a new kind of communication platform:

- 🗣️ **AI-Powered Voice Agent**: Every user can train and own their own AI voice assistant to handle calls, translate languages, or attend meetings on their behalf.
- 🔐 **Decentralized and Private**: Your conversations and identity are protected by Web3 infrastructure. You control your data — not any centralized server.
- 💸 **Crypto Payments Built-In**: Seamlessly send and receive cryptocurrency while chatting — powered by integrated Web3 wallets.
- 🤖 **Human + Bot Ecosystem**: Both people and AI agents have equal identities (IDs) and can interact through apps or APIs just like citizens in a digital world.
- 🎁 **Token Incentives**: As you use Beagle, your AI becomes smarter, and you earn **Beagle Tokens**.

## 🌍 What is Decent Network?

> Today's social network are not open networks — they are social app or walled gardens.

**[Decent Network](https://decent.network)** is not just a social protocol — it's a next-generation, peer-to-peer communication infrastructure built **on top of the Internet**, not bound by IP addresses or domains.

### Key Innovations:

- 🔗 **Global P2P Mesh Network**: Devices connect directly in a global mesh network without relying on static IPs, ports, or DNS. If a device is online, it’s reachable.
- ❌ No more **[ngrok](https://github.com/NGROK)**, port forwarding, or centralized relays — this network **replaces traditional tunneling solutions** with a fully decentralized overlay.
- 🧠 **Decentralized Identity**: Both humans and AI agents have cryptographically verifiable IDs.
- 💬 **Built-in Messaging + Payments**: Text, voice, video, and crypto transfers — all natively supported via open protocols.
- 🛠️ **Developer-Friendly**: Any app or agent can plug into the network with equal access — no gatekeepers.

> It's not just decentralized — it's truly **peer-to-peer**, and future-proof for the AI age.
