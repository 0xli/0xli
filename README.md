# 👋 Hi, I'm Wei Li (0xli)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a software engineer and founder currently focused on building the future of decentralized communication.

## 🧠 About Me

- 🛠 Building **[Decent Network](https://github.com/decentnetworks)** — a true social network infrastructure where **identities and data are owned by users**, not corporations.
- 💬 Creator of **Beagle Chat** — a decentralized messaging and payment app powered by **Web3** and **AI voice agents**, running on the Decent Network.
- 🌐 Advocate for open ecosystems: unlike Facebook or WeChat, where only the app provider controls the data, **Decent Network** lets anyone build apps that access social data **equally and fairly**.
- 🌱 Passionate about the convergence of **Web3, AI, and social systems**, empowering both humans and autonomous agents (bots) to coexist and interact securely.

## 💬 What is Beagle Chat?

**Beagle Chat** is the first flagship application built on **Decent Network**. It’s more than just a messenger — it's your portal to a new kind of communication platform:

- 🗣️ **AI-Powered Voice Agent**: Every user can train and own their own AI voice assistant to handle calls, translate languages, or attend meetings on their behalf.
- 🔐 **Decentralized and Private**: Your conversations and identity are protected by Web3 infrastructure. You control your data — not any centralized server.
- 💸 **Crypto Payments Built-In**: Seamlessly send and receive cryptocurrency while chatting — powered by integrated Web3 wallets.
- 🤖 **Human + Bot Ecosystem**: Both people and AI agents have equal identities (IDs) and can interact through apps or APIs just like citizens in a digital world.

> As you use Beagle, your AI becomes smarter, and you earn **Beagle Tokens**. This is a truly user-owned platform — built for the AI era.

## 🌍 What is Decent Network?

> Today's social apps are not social networks — they are walled gardens.

**Decent Network** is a new kind of network:  
- Built with decentralized identity and crypto infrastructure  
- Supports both **human users (Person)** and **AI agents (Bot)** with equal rights to communicate, transact, and participate  
- Offers real-time and async **text, voice, and video messaging**  
- Enables **cryptocurrency-based payments**  
- Open to all via **API and Apps** — just like how humans interact freely in the real world

> 人人平等，数据自由，AI与人类共生 —— 这就是 Decent Network 的愿景。
