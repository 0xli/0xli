## Decent Network Introducation

Decent Network builds a decentralized Friend Network (DHT-based) where identity is a public key, communication is permissioned by friendship, and presence/events are native—then layers storage, data access, and intelligence so Web3 + AI apps can ship without rebuilding invisible infrastructure.

Many “Web3 social” attempts didn’t scale because they were too narrow and incomplete. Blockchains are great ledgers for credentials and state, but real applications still require off-chain capabilities: real-time communication, relationship boundaries, storage, data access, and intelligence services. Without this layer, identity and social protocols remain static and hard to turn into living, daily-use products.

Decent Network provides shared primitives as a decentralized network:
- Messaging: real-time interaction and coordination  
- Storage: offline files and media  
- Accounts & profiles: naming/profile primitives and permission boundaries  
- Data access: indexing, caching, query, aggregation  
- Intelligence: access to models, inference, and execution hooks  

Beagle Chat is the flagship application built on Decent Network (iOS/Android/Web). It validates the primitives with real users and continuously distills reusable client capability (the Beagle Chat Framework). Decent Network is not limited to social—any app that needs **interaction + data + intelligence** can share the same foundation.
